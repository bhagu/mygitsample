Version Control System for Tracking changes in computer files

Distributed Version Control System
Coordinates work between multiple developers
tracks every single version and every single change that is made in the project
Revert back any changes as long as it is committed to the repository

No need of internet connection to work on the local - however to push to the remote one, you would need the net connection

Concepts:
Keeps track of code history
Takes "snapshots" of your files
You decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
You can visit any snapshot at any time
You can stage files before committing

Basic Commands:

git init        ## Initialize local git repository
git add <file>      ## Add file to index
git status     ##check status of working tree
git commit      ##commit changes in index

git push    ##Push to remote repository
git pull      ##pull latest from remote repository
git clone      ## clone repository into a new directory


git rm --cached filename   ## to remove the file from staging area

git add .   ##add all the files in the folder to staging area

git commit
press i to insert comment
esc + wq for saving the commit
